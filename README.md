# ðŸŒž Sun Tracking Solar Panel System

> Dual Axis Solar Tracker using Arduino and LDRs for enhanced solar energy capture.

##  Abstract

The growing demand for clean energy has driven the need for more efficient solar power systems. This project presents a dual-axis solar tracking system using Arduino Mega, Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs), and servo motors. The tracker ensures that the solar panel remains perpendicular to the sunâ€™s rays throughout the day, maximizing energy generation.

> ðŸ“ˆ The designed system achieves an **annual energy gain of 48.98%** over static panels, and **36.5% over single-axis trackers**.

##  Working Principle

- Four LDRs are placed in a cross formation to sense light intensity.
- Arduino reads these values and adjusts servo motors accordingly.
- The panel rotates **horizontally and vertically** to align with the sun.
- Tracker maintains **perpendicular alignment** for maximum power.
